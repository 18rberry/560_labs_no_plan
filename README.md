# 560_labs_no_plan


Team Name: NoPlan 

Team Members: Riya Berry | Benjamin Lu | Ryan Tung 

This repo illustrates our lab assignmnets for DSCI 560 (Spring 2026). For Lab 5, please visit "lab_5" (code & PDF of lab report). We will also update the Github once we have published our demo video. 

For our final project, we would like to create a group chat/messaging app that allows group members to effectively plan trips and vacations together. This would allow couples, friend groups, families, and other communities to organize, coordinate, and communicate with each other regarding travel plans. With our app, people won't need a plan -- they can just use our AI agent **No Plan!**
