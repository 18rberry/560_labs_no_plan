This repo illustrates our lab assignmnets for DSCI 560 (Spring 2026). For Lab 6, please visit "Oil_Wells_Data_Analysis" (code & PDF of lab report). In this lab, we focus on extract text, web scraping, data processing, and GIS/Visualization from scanned pdf data about oil wells across the nation. We will also update the Github once we have published our demo video. 

Below are some examples of our web visualization of oil wells!

For our final project, we would like to create a group chat/messaging app that allows group members to effectively plan trips and vacations together. This would allow couples, friend groups, families, and other communities to organize, coordinate, and communicate with each other regarding travel plans. With our app, people won't need a plan -- they can just use our AI agent **No Plan!**
