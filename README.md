This repo illustrates our lab assignmnets for DSCI 560 (Spring 2026). For Lab 3, please visit "lab_3" (part 1, PDF of lab report) and "lab_3_convolution" (part 2). We have also provided our code files for part 2 in ".vscode" folder. 

For our final project, we would like to create a group chat/messaging app that allows group members to effectively plan trips and vacations together. This would allow couples, friend groups, families, and other communities to organize, coordinate, and communicate with each other regarding travel plans. With our app, people won't need a plan -- they can just use our AI agent **No Plan!**
